# FIFA-Supervised-Learning-Model

## Defining the Metric for Success
* To create a model using Polynomial Regression and predict how many goals the home team and away team scores
* To create a model using Logistic Regression and predict whether the home team will win, draw or lose
* To obtain a low RMSE(<10% of mean of predicted feature) and high Accuracy(>90%) Score of the Polynomial and Logistic Regression Models respectively

## Experimental Design
* Perform EDA
* Perform any necessary feature engineering
* Check of multicollinearity
* Modelling
* Cross-validate the model
* Compute RMSE and Accuracy Scores
* Create residual plots for your models, and assess their heteroscedasticity using Bartlettâ€™s test
